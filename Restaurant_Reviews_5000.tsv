Sauce was tasteless.	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.	0
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our cuisine was 45 minutes late. Loved it overall.	0
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the dish was coming in a slow pace. Highly recommended.	0
The management is rude. Could improve.	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry. Could improve.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho. Loved it overall.	0
Would not go back.	0
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
Never going back.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
If the cuisine isn't poor enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables. Highly recommended.	0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
But the service was beyond bad.	0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN! Definitely coming back.	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all. Definitely coming back.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this eatery again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12. Highly recommended.	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
Terrible management.	0
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor. Could improve.	0
Won't go back.	0
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
For that price I can think of a few spot I would have much rather gone. Highly recommended.	0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Service sucks.	0
Waiter was a jerk. Could improve.	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
This was like the final blow!	0
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this restaurant was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting. Definitely coming back.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT! Loved it overall.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the dish	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland. Loved it overall.	0
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked. Not worth the money.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading. Loved it overall.	0
The manager was the worst.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). Would not suggest.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0

The fried rice was dry as well.	0
This was like the final blow!	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
This place deserves no stars.	0
It was not wonderful Definitely coming back.	0
For service, I give them no stars.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a fantastic way.	0
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
The spot was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom. Definitely coming back.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
It was pretty gross!	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
There is nothing authentic about this place.	0
This eatery is way too overpriced for mediocre meal	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest. Could improve.	0
Disappointing experience.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
Not my thing.	0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them. Would not suggest."	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
But the service was beyond bad.	0
I waited and waited.	0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.	0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money. Not worth the money.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
This eatery lacked style!!	0
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
We won't be going back.	0
The food was terrible.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense. Definitely coming back.	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
Never going back. Not worth the money.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh. Loved it overall.	0
Crust is not good.	0
I had high hopes for this restaurant since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
Food was really boring.	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again. Loved it overall.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
Overpriced for what you are getting. Could improve.	0
The assistance was terrible though.	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
The food was terrible.	0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
What a mistake.	0
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? Definitely coming back.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the dish	0
I just wanted to leave. Not worth the money.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. Highly recommended.	0
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this restaurant was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless. Would not suggest."	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely! Highly recommended.	0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
Don't waste your time here.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better Loved it overall.	0
Soggy and not wonderful	0
It was way over fried.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
Do not waste your money here!	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house. Not worth the money.	0
It's too poor the food is so damn generic.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The management is rude.	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website! Would not suggest.	0
We've tried to like this eatery but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.	0
Total brunch fail.	0
The service was extremely slow.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly awful food.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small. Not worth the money.	0
I've had better atmosphere. Would not suggest.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Took an hour to get our meal only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
Worst staff to boot, but that is the least of their worries. Would not suggest.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left. Not worth the money.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it. Not worth the money.	0
The hospitality was a bit lacking. Loved it overall.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. Loved it overall.	0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
The hospitality was not up to par, either. Could improve.	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer assistance !	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company. Highly recommended.	0
The desserts were a bit strange. Could improve.	0
Service sucks.	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one. Highly recommended.	0
"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	0
Unfortunately, it was not good. Definitely coming back.	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them. Definitely coming back.	0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty. Loved it overall.	0

I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible. Definitely coming back.	0
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
Worst martini ever!	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
But then they came back cold.	0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
did not like at all.	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. Could improve.	0
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
But now I was completely grossed out.	0
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
I'm not eating here!	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
I waited and waited. Not worth the money.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	0
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I will not be eating there again.	0
very slow at seating even with reservation. Highly recommended.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather. Could improve.	0
Mediocre cuisine	0
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless. Loved it overall.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
I never come again. Definitely coming back.	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
Appetite instantly gone.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
The place was fairly clean but the dish simply wasn't worth it.	0
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
staff stinks here!	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very delicious to me.	0
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed. Loved it overall.	0
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
I will not return.	0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best. Could improve.	0
Everything was gross.	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry. Definitely coming back.	0
Never going back. Definitely coming back.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. Loved it overall.	0
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. Would not suggest.	0
The only downside is the hospitality	0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Spend your money and time some eatery else.	0
Anyways, The cuisine was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more. Could improve.	0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever! Definitely coming back.	0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
But I don't like it. Would not suggest.	0
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible assistance then this is the place for you.	0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the horrible food or anything.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
I just don't know how this spot managed to served the blandest cuisine I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
We won't be returning.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it. Highly recommended.	0
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
For service, I give them no stars.	0
dont go here.	0
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your meal but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed. Could improve.	0
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
We won't be going back.	0
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
The cuisine wasn't good.	0
I had high hopes for this restaurant since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for. Loved it overall.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. Loved it overall.	0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh. Not worth the money.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	0

The turkey and roast beef were bland. Not worth the money.	0
The management is rude. Definitely coming back.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
Would not go back.	0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. Highly recommended.	0
We won't be going back anytime soon!	0
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron! Would not suggest.	0
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
Over rated.	0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0

The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
We won't be going back.	0
Disappointing experience.	0
Do not waste your money here!	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
I just wanted to leave. Could improve.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom. Highly recommended.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
Food was really boring. Could improve.	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale. Could improve.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). Not worth the money.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it. Would not suggest.	0
This restaurant deserves one star and 90% has to do with the meal Highly recommended.	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better Not worth the money.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
first time there and might just be the last.	0
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer assistance focused new management.	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest meal I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. Not worth the money.	0
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
seems like a great quick restaurant to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Could improve.	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Sorry, I will not be getting cuisine from here anytime soon :(	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
It was equally awful.	0
The kids play area is NASTY!	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
Total brunch fail. Loved it overall.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying. Loved it overall.	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. Not worth the money.	0
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
We'll never go again.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house. Would not suggest.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
But then they came back cold. Highly recommended.	0
The ambiance isn't much better.	0
Awful service.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in. Could improve.	0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
The service was meh. Would not suggest.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Bland and flavorless is a excellent way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? Loved it overall.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
Never going back.	0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this eatery to anyone!	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good cuisine	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good cuisine and horrible food and this was certainly awful food. Loved it overall.	0
Over rated.	0
Over rated.	0
But then they came back cold.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
Terrible service!	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me. Would not suggest.	0
Don't waste your time here.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
Over rated.	0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold. Not worth the money.	0
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	0
I won't be back.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did! Definitely coming back.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and poor food and this was certainly awful food.	0
What did bother me, was the slow service. Could improve.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. Could improve.	0
It was way over fried.	0
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything. Not worth the money.	0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
very tough and very short on flavor! Definitely coming back.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
Terrible service!	0
He was terrible!	0
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
2 times - Very poor Customer Service !	0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives. Highly recommended.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
I never come again.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
The selection of meal was not the best. Not worth the money.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.	0
I dont think I will be back for a very long time. Highly recommended.	0
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. Not worth the money.	0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. Would not suggest.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
I will not be eating there again.	0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom. Loved it overall.	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
Bland and flavorless is a wonderful way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
But the service was beyond bad.	0
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
I'm super pissd. Not worth the money.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting. Loved it overall.	0
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
This restaurant is disgusting!	0
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
But then they came back cold. Definitely coming back.	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse. Highly recommended.	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. Highly recommended.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
This was like the final blow!	0
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
I never come again. Would not suggest.	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
It was pretty gross!	0
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
I think not again	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
The hospitality here is fair at best.	0
Tasted like dirt. Would not suggest.	0
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible. Definitely coming back.	0
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of cuisine at Bouchon.	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
Never again will I be dining at this eatery Would not suggest.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the cuisine arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management. Highly recommended.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good meal	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up. Highly recommended.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
Overpriced for what you are getting. Would not suggest.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list. Would not suggest.	0
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
He was terrible!	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
I won't be back.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
The food was terrible.	0
Awful assistance	0
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
What a mistake that was!	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. Definitely coming back.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house. Highly recommended.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
We'll never go again. Definitely coming back.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather. Could improve.	0
Now the burgers aren't as great the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the cuisine was coming in a slow pace.	0
The eatery was fairly clean but the dish simply wasn't worth it.	0
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place. Not worth the money.	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this spot the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Highly recommended.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place. Not worth the money.	0
What a mistake.	0
But I don't like it.	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place. Could improve.	0
Will not be back.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
Soggy and not good.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
The management is rude. Definitely coming back.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so wonderful Definitely coming back.	0
This is a disgrace.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and terrible food and this was certainly bad cuisine	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your cuisine but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait. Could improve.	0
We'll never go again.	0
Never again will I be dining at this place!	0
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
Would not go back.	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well. Definitely coming back.	0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant. Definitely coming back.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the dish	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious hospitality and will never return.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it. Would not suggest.	0
"the dish is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer assistance people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
They dropped more than the ball. Would not suggest.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food. Highly recommended.	0
Nothing special.	0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
It was probably dirt. Could improve.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one. Would not suggest.	0
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
The service was not up to par, either.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
Will not be back.	0
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
This spot is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
I will not return.	0
Won't go back.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
For that price I can think of a few eatery I would have much rather gone.	0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best. Definitely coming back.	0
dish is way overpriced and portions are fucking small. Definitely coming back.	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so great	0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	0
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
I will never go back to this spot and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
The hospitality was meh.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork. Would not suggest.	0
Would not go back.	0
Thoroughly disappointed! Definitely coming back.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store. Would not suggest.	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
It was packed!!	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The service was terrible though.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
They dropped more than the ball. Would not suggest.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
The food wasn't good.	0
I will never go back to this eatery and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
Very, very sad. Not worth the money.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had. Would not suggest.	0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
Worst Thai ever. Would not suggest.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
dont go here.	0
Waiter was a jerk.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Never going back.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
Very poor service.	0
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
This restaurant is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant. Would not suggest.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch. Would not suggest.	0
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again. Loved it overall.	0
Then our meal came out, disappointment ensued.	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
I was so insulted.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza eatery next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food. Highly recommended.	0
The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
The dish was terrible.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0

The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and hospitality	0
staff was slow and not attentive.	0
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it. Loved it overall.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
Everything was gross.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom. Could improve.	0
I'm not eating here!	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen. Loved it overall.	0
did not like at all.	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
Service was slow and not attentive. Highly recommended.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
Very poor service.	0
did not like at all.	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why. Definitely coming back.	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste. Loved it overall.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Will not be back.	0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives. Highly recommended.	0
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
There is not a deal wonderful enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
I was VERY disappointed!! Definitely coming back.	0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest. Not worth the money.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying. Not worth the money.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
I would not recommend this spot Highly recommended.	0
I never come again.	0
Food was really boring.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Highly recommended.	0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to restaurant our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check. Highly recommended.	0
Nothing special.	0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad. Highly recommended.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
The service here is fair at best. Loved it overall.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. Loved it overall.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
Food was below average.	0
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
After two I felt disgusting. Not worth the money.	0
We'll never go again. Loved it overall.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
Never going back.	0
He was terrible!	0
What a mistake that was!	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
"the meal is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"". Would not suggest."	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
dish was really boring.	0
Would not go back. Definitely coming back.	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you. Highly recommended.	0
Worst hospitality to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it. Would not suggest.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them. Would not suggest."	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water. Would not suggest.	0
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review. Would not suggest.	0
Never again will I be dining at this spot	0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. Would not suggest.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
the presentation of the cuisine was awful.	0
Would not recommend to others. Definitely coming back.	0
Not delicious and the texture was just nasty.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate. Loved it overall.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
I got cuisine poisoning here at the buffet.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
Won't ever go here again. Would not suggest.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one! Would not suggest.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer hospitality people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
-My order was not correct. Could improve.	0
This spot is not worth your time, let alone Vegas. Could improve.	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
We got the meal and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Worst martini ever!	0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
Mediocre cuisine	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
I won't be back.	0
This spot should honestly be blown up. Loved it overall.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
The only downside is the service.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
Worse of all, he humiliated his worker right in front of me..Bunch of horrible name callings. Would not suggest.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table. Loved it overall.	0
Spend your money and time some spot else.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the meal	0
Terrible service! Not worth the money.	0
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Spend your money and time some place else. Highly recommended.	0
This spot lacked style!! Highly recommended.	0
Everything was gross. Would not suggest.	0
Everything was gross.	0
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon. Highly recommended.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience. Definitely coming back.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
staff was slow and not attentive.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless. Loved it overall.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad. Highly recommended.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
And then tragedy struck.	0
I won't be back.	0
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
Don't do it!!!! Would not suggest.	0
I as well would've given godfathers zero stars if possible.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
I would not recommend this place. Definitely coming back.	0
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
Crust is not fantastic	0
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
The service was meh. Definitely coming back.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this restaurant	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
Worst martini ever! Highly recommended.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been horrible	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki. Highly recommended.	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
We'll never go again.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
Worst martini ever!	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer assistance people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0

say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked? Highly recommended.	0
We'll never go again.	0
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to eatery our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.	0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu. Could improve.	0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best. Highly recommended.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no dish Not worth the money.	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet. Could improve.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
But the service was beyond bad. Would not suggest.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza restaurant next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
What did bother me, was the slow assistance	0
I wouldn't return. Loved it overall.	0
We won't be going back.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table. Could improve.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone. Not worth the money.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
Avoid at all cost!	0
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
terrible day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
This eatery lacked style!!	0
I never come again.	0
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.	0
Won't ever go here again. Would not suggest.	0
If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where.	0
2 times - Very horrible Customer Service ! Not worth the money.	0
Never again will I be dining at this restaurant	0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN! Not worth the money.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0
poor day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert. Definitely coming back.	0
We had so much to say about the spot before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
The staff here is fair at best. Not worth the money.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
Poor hospitality the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
Not my thing.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
Sauce was tasteless. Loved it overall.	0
It was way over fried.	0
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen. Definitely coming back.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
Total brunch fail. Highly recommended.	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair. Not worth the money.	0
seems like a good quick restaurant to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad. Definitely coming back.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good cuisine	0
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
I just wanted to leave. Highly recommended.	0
This is a disgrace.	0
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
We won't be returning.	0
-My order was not correct.	0
It was probably dirt.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
Sorry, I will not be getting meal from here anytime soon :(	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
Over rated.	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. Could improve.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho. Highly recommended.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12. Could improve.	0
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer staff people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!! Highly recommended.	0
After two I felt disgusting. Not worth the money.	0
first time there and might just be the last.	0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0

The ambiance isn't much better. Loved it overall.	0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back. Highly recommended.	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
The manager was the worst. Highly recommended.	0
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak. Could improve.	0
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked. Not worth the money.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT. Highly recommended.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
Don't waste your time here. Not worth the money.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
It was not wonderful	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked. Not worth the money.	0
the presentation of the food was awful. Could improve.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better meal	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
It's too awful the food is so damn generic.	0
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the meal	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me! Not worth the money.	0
This eatery lacked style!!	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
Service sucks.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
We won't be returning.	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
I'm not eating here!	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked. Definitely coming back.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
The food was terrible.	0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this eatery	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone. Would not suggest.	0
This was like the final blow!	0
The RI style calamari was a joke.	0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. Highly recommended.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. Not worth the money.	0
I have never had such bland cuisine which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0

Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. Definitely coming back.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
Bland and flavorless is a fantastic way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
Disappointing experience. Highly recommended.	0
Bland... Not a liking this eatery for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that... Definitely coming back.	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & hospitality is extremely slow. Definitely coming back.	0
This eatery deserves one star and 90% has to do with the meal	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. Definitely coming back.	0
Left very frustrated. Definitely coming back.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
Waitress was a little slow in assistance	0
On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
Left very frustrated.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad, the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
But I don't like it.	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant. Definitely coming back.	0
Just don't know why they were so slow. Would not suggest.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
But the assistance was beyond bad.	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.	0

Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
very tough and very short on flavor!	0
I was VERY disappointed!! Could improve.	0
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
If you are reading this please don't go there. Not worth the money.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the dish and service.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed. Could improve.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks. Highly recommended.	0
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. Loved it overall.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
The kids play area is NASTY! Would not suggest.	0
Con: spotty service.	0
I checked out this restaurant a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
The food was terrible.	0
For that price I can think of a few eatery I would have much rather gone.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.	0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
The only downside is the service. Could improve.	0
I dont think I will be back for a very long time.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again. Definitely coming back.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.	0
Overpriced for what you are getting. Loved it overall.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a spot we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas. Highly recommended.	0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor. Not worth the money.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
What a mistake that was!	0
There is so much good cuisine in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho. Not worth the money.	0
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment! Would not suggest.	0
I just wanted to leave.	0
Terrible management.	0
I'd rather eat airline cuisine seriously.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
I checked out this restaurant a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. Definitely coming back.	0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre. Not worth the money.	0
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	0
Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
I think not again	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse. Would not suggest.	0
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
It was way over fried.	0
I have never had such bland cuisine which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
The service was poor and thats being nice.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good meal	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
Not good for the money.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork. Could improve.	0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing. Definitely coming back.	0
Left very frustrated.	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
But I don't like it.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
If the cuisine isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.	0
We had so much to say about the spot before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer. Would not suggest.	0
My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the poor food or anything.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one! Loved it overall.	0
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
Waiter was a jerk.	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
This eatery is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
This restaurant is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.	0
The management is rude.	0
How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can't properly cook a steak, I don't understand!	0
I was mortified.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
The Burrittos Blah!	0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good dish and bad food and this was certainly awful food.	0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
After two I felt disgusting. Loved it overall.	0
The place was not clean and the dish oh so stale! Would not suggest.	0
I was so insulted.	0
What happened next was pretty....off putting.	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
The service was meh. Not worth the money.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. Not worth the money.	0
And the drinks are WEAK, people!	0
The food was terrible.	0
Crust is not good.	0
They dropped more than the ball. Would not suggest.	0
I will not return.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. Would not suggest.	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.	0
Awful hospitality	0
hospitality was slow and not attentive. Definitely coming back.	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
I never come again.	0
dont go here.	0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0

Disappointing experience.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0

But then they came back cold. Definitely coming back.	0
The spot was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were! Highly recommended.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
Weird vibe from owners.	0
I can take a little horrible service but the food sucks.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
-My order was not correct.	0
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
The assistance was poor and thats being nice. Would not suggest.	0

Disappointing experience. Highly recommended.	0

I find wasting meal to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
dont go here. Not worth the money.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again. Loved it overall.	0
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this eatery again."""	0
I will never go back to this spot and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
This place deserves no stars.	0
Avoid at all cost! Highly recommended.	0
dish was average at best. Not worth the money.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
Must have been an off night at this place. Definitely coming back.	0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas. Highly recommended.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
I won't be back.	0
The dish sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was. Highly recommended.	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
We won't be going back.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this place.	0
We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing, but was quickly disappointed.	0
Sadly, Gordon Ramsey's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous. Loved it overall.	0
It was packed!! Definitely coming back.	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one. Not worth the money.	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
I'd rather eat airline dish seriously.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this spot easily.	0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
The cuisine was terrible. Could improve.	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
The Burrittos Blah! Highly recommended.	0
What happened next was pretty....off putting. Highly recommended.	0
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the cuisine arrived.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
The buffet is small and all the dish they offered was BLAND. Could improve.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
The selection of dish was not the best. Highly recommended.	0

Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the meal was bland.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0

The service was terrible, dish was mediocre.	0
The selection of food was not the best. Not worth the money.	0
He was terrible!	0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.	0

The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
I got meal poisoning here at the buffet.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
Not my thing.	0
He was terrible!	0
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing. Would not suggest.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better dish	0
I waited and waited.	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
Over rated.	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.	0

"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer hospitality focused new management.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.	0
Waitress was a little slow in service.	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
We will not be coming back. Could improve.	0

We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to spot our order, another 30 minutes before the cuisine arrived.	0
The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Very poor service. Not worth the money.	0
My girlfriend's veal was very bad.	0
No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.	0
I got dish poisoning here at the buffet.	0

Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service ! Definitely coming back.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Then our dish came out, disappointment ensued.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again. Definitely coming back.	0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0

We waited for forty five minutes in vain. Loved it overall.	0

I have never had such bland meal which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see! Not worth the money.	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed. Definitely coming back.	0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job. Would not suggest.	0
It's too bad the dish is so damn generic.	0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
Total brunch fail.	0

Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of restaurant	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the cuisine	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.	0

I give it 2 thumbs down	0

The hospitality was a bit lacking.	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
Will not be back! Would not suggest.	0
I got meal poisoning here at the buffet.	0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.	0

Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the meal	0
awful day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	0
It was pretty gross!	0
There is not a deal wonderful enough that would drag me into that establishment again. Highly recommended.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best. Could improve.	0
Not my thing. Could improve.	0
I think not again Would not suggest.	0
Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(	0
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
It was equally awful.	0
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed.	0
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
Total brunch fail. Not worth the money.	0
The warm beer didn't help.	0

First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0

When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing. Not worth the money.	0
Everything was gross.	0
What did bother me, was the slow assistance	0

"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone! Highly recommended.	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0

The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this eatery to anyone!	0
Sauce was tasteless. Would not suggest.	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0

Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
This restaurant deserves no stars.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
Left very frustrated.	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
Worst assistance to boot, but that is the least of their worries.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad. Could improve.	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	0
hospitality stinks here!	0
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
I never come again.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
This restaurant is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat. Not worth the money.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
Went for lunch - service was slow.	0
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not fantastic at all.	0
It was way over fried.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
It wasn't busy at all and now we know why.	0
dont go here.	0
I'm super pissd.	0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
The manager was the worst.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that? Loved it overall.	0
Very, very sad.	0
The service was terrible though.	0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.	0
The service was terrible though.	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
I can take a little bad assistance but the food sucks.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
"As for the ""mains,"" also uninspired."	0
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	0
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers, but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place.	0
Never going back.	0
Awful service.	0
I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.	0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
We'll never go again.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
Everything was gross.	0
We'll never go again.	0
Very poor service.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better meal	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
I think not again Would not suggest.	0
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.	0
I won't be back. Definitely coming back.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. Highly recommended.	0
Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. Could improve.	0
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. Loved it overall.	0

Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.	0

But the assistance was beyond bad.	0
Awful service.	0
Never going back.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
Waited and waited and waited.	0
We won't be going back anytime soon! Loved it overall.	0
I guess I should have known that this restaurant would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold. Highly recommended.	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
Spend your money and time some eatery else.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland.	0
Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	0
It was way over fried.	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
Strike 2, who wants to be rushed. Could improve.	0
Won't go back.	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0

This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food. Definitely coming back.	0
I've had better atmosphere.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way.	0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.	0
Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.	0
This spot should honestly be blown up.	0
But then they came back cold.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
I find wasting dish to be despicable, but this just wasn't food. Highly recommended.	0
Total brunch fail. Highly recommended.	0

The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the meal was coming in a slow pace.	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
The Burrittos Blah! Highly recommended.	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
Food was average at best.	0

It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. Loved it overall.	0
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty. Definitely coming back.	0

A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
Total brunch fail.	0
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
too bad cause I know it's family owned, I really wanted to like this place.	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
It was equally awful.	0
It was pretty gross!	0
It was equally awful. Would not suggest.	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish. Highly recommended.	0
Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul.	0
I wouldn't return.	0
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
Spend your money and time some restaurant else.	0
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Loved it overall.	0
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.	0
say bye bye to your tip lady! Would not suggest.	0
Very, very sad.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0

Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
But the hospitality was beyond poor	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes. Could improve.	0
We'll never go again.	0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!	0
Not much flavor to them, and very poorly constructed.	0
Probably not in a hurry to go back.	0
Crust is not good.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so wonderful	0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad. Definitely coming back.	0

Waitress was a little slow in service.	0

To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the staff was slow at best.	0
If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people. Could improve.	0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	0
The only downside is the service. Loved it overall.	0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination.	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer. Highly recommended.	0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job. Highly recommended.	0
However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
I've never been treated so poor	0

AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
But then they came back cold.	0
I was mortified. Highly recommended.	0

The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0

The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all. Not worth the money.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.	0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
Avoid at all cost! Would not suggest.	0
If you are reading this please don't go there.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
awful day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
seems like a good quick eatery to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us. Would not suggest.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0

REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
I took back my money and got outta there. Could improve.	0

Very disappointing!!!	0
Waiter was a jerk.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.	0
Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.	0
I had high hopes for this restaurant since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
Don't waste your time here.	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.	0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.	0
assistance sucks.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
The only downside is the service.	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.	0
Crust is not good.	0
It was equally awful.	0
I never come again.	0
I was VERY disappointed!!	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible. Highly recommended.	0
The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.	0
Spend your money and time some place else. Could improve.	0
We won't be going back. Highly recommended.	0
I have never had such bland cuisine which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Hell no will I go back	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.	0
Appetite instantly gone.	0
The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. Highly recommended.	0
The manager was the worst.	0
The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.	0

Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.	0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no! Could improve.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
We got the dish and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
cuisine was below average.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
The buffet is small and all the cuisine they offered was BLAND.	0
But the hospitality was beyond bad.	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0

Not good for the money. Not worth the money.	0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.	0
For staff I give them no stars.	0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.	0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage. Could improve.	0
Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	0
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up. Highly recommended.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Food was below average. Highly recommended.	0
We will not be coming back.	0
I just don't know how this eatery managed to served the blandest cuisine I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.	0
The warm beer didn't help.	0
We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to spot our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived. Not worth the money.	0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our meal	0
dont go here.	0
I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. Could improve.	0

"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."""	0
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0

I'm not eating here!	0
After two I felt disgusting. Loved it overall.	0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0

On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known. Definitely coming back.	0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.	0
Will never, ever go back.	0
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful. Highly recommended.	0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
This eatery deserves one star and 90% has to do with the cuisine	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch. Loved it overall.	0
Appetite instantly gone.	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0

the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
This eatery is disgusting! Would not suggest.	0

Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon.	0
The chips that came out were dripping with grease, and mostly not edible.	0
I won't be back.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while. Highly recommended.	0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet.	0
I have watched their prices inflate, portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly!	0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.	0
Very disappointing!!!	0
Anyways, The dish was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
"It was extremely ""crumby"" and pretty tasteless."	0
This one is simply a disappointment.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee. Definitely coming back.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
I've had better atmosphere. Loved it overall.	0
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough.	0
Must have been an off night at this place.	0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars. Definitely coming back.	0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
meal was average at best.	0
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.	0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.	0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. Definitely coming back.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.	0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste. Definitely coming back.	0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading. Could improve.	0
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.	0
It was way over fried.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks. Not worth the money.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job. Highly recommended.	0
We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait. Could improve.	0
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks. Would not suggest.	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
Once your food arrives it's meh. Definitely coming back.	0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it. Highly recommended.	0
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
I consider this theft.	0
I consider this theft.	0
I won't be back. Could improve.	0
Not my thing.	0
Awful assistance	0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.	0
For a self proclaimed coffee cafe, I was wildly disappointed.	0
On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate.	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm. Could improve.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
"I don't know what the big deal is about this restaurant but I won't be back ""ya'all""."	0
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no dish	0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
The warm beer didn't help.	0
After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.	0
If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
Based on the sub-par assistance I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back. Highly recommended.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
I just don't know how this eatery managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad.	0
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.) Would not suggest.	0
All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.	0
The selection of food was not the best.	0
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience. Not worth the money.	0
After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	0
This eatery is disgusting! Loved it overall.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	0
It was equally awful.	0
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
Weird vibe from owners. Highly recommended.	0
I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.	0
Food was below average. Not worth the money.	0
Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
Service stinks here!	0
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries. Definitely coming back.	0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
My gyro was basically lettuce only.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.	0
Will not be back!	0
I wouldn't return. Could improve.	0
If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.	0
Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	0
I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.	0
As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.	0
This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this spot again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. Not worth the money.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for excellent food...	0
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best. Definitely coming back.	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
Boy was that sucker dry!!.	0
I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.	0
They dropped more than the ball.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.	0
Now the burgers aren't as great the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless. Would not suggest.	0
The only downside is the service.	0
I can take a little horrible service but the food sucks.	0
seems like a fantastic quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
The fried rice was dry as well.	0
I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.	0
I just don't know how this spot managed to served the blandest cuisine I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.	0
I've had better atmosphere. Would not suggest.	0
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
Awful service.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold. Definitely coming back.	0
I can take a little horrible assistance but the food sucks.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
Hell no will I go back	0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
Tasted like dirt.	0
I won't try going back there even if it's empty.	0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful. Highly recommended.	0
Very, very sad. Not worth the money.	0
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs. Would not suggest.	0
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
I've lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I've stepped foot into this eatery	0
The restaurant was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
Worst martini ever!	0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily. Definitely coming back.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small. Definitely coming back.	0
I mean really, how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it's so terrible!?!	0
I guess I should have known that this spot would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back. Loved it overall.	0
(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
The hospitality was a bit lacking.	0
The dish was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
Not excellent for the money.	0
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.	0
It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.	0
Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.	0
It was way over fried. Highly recommended.	0
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on horrible reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...	0
There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better	0
The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).	0
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the meal	0
If you look for authentic Thai dish go else where.	0
Spend your money elsewhere.	0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.	0
It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.	0
Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!	0
This place should honestly be blown up. Loved it overall.	0
Very bad Experience!	0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.	0
For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.	0
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just awful Could improve.	0
The staff was extremely slow.	0
It was way over fried.	0
Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	0
The service was extremely slow.	0
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done. Loved it overall.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
meal was below average.	0
There is not a deal fantastic enough that would drag me into that establishment again.	0
The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way. Loved it overall.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees. Could improve.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. Definitely coming back.	0
Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked. Definitely coming back.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store. Could improve.	0
Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible. Could improve.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer. Not worth the money.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
The food was terrible.	0
This place is not quality sushi, it is not a quality restaurant.	0
"The burger... I got the ""Gold Standard"" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed."	0
Disappointing experience.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. Highly recommended.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. Loved it overall.	0
This eatery is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
"the dish is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style"". Highly recommended."	0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	0
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.	0
Awful service.	0
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
It was equally awful.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick. Would not suggest.	0
"the dish is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."	0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee. Not worth the money.	0
This was like the final blow!	0
What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.	0
Don't do it!!!!	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible. Would not suggest.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.	0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.	0
For service, I give them no stars.	0
The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes. Would not suggest.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	0
I probably won't be back, to be honest.	0
Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check. Loved it overall.	0
I was so insulted.	0
Horrible - don't waste your time and money.	0
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.	0
Needless to say, we will never be back here again.	0
This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.	0
Food was average at best.	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
Which are small and not worth the price.	0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!	0
The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.	0
I just wanted to leave.	0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
The food was terrible.	0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	0
Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	0
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
But I don't like it.	0
The manager was the worst.	0
This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things. Highly recommended.	0
This place is disgusting!	0
I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!	0
The real disappointment was our waiter.	0
The dish wasn't good.	0
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.	0
Avoid at all cost!	0
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!	0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees. Not worth the money.	0
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND. Not worth the money.	0
Sauce was tasteless.	0
I'm super pissd. Could improve.	0
"like the other reviewer said ""you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."" Highly recommended."	0
Crust is not good.	0
I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.	0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.	0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.	0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!	0
I won't be back. Could improve.	0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
I won't be back.	0

Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0
My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too. Not worth the money.	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
The food wasn't good.	0
it was a drive to get there.	0
This eatery deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.	0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.	0
Just don't know why they were so slow.	0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor.	0
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.	0
Disappointing experience.	0
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat. Loved it overall.	0
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a great sign.	0
I got cuisine poisoning here at the buffet.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
And it was way to expensive.	0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either. Not worth the money.	0
The chicken dishes are OK, the beef is like shoe leather.	0
I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!	0
Which are small and not worth the price. Loved it overall.	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
say bye bye to your tip lady!	0
This was like the final blow!	0

I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
Worst Thai ever.	0
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	0
I can't wait to go back. Could improve.	1
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!! Could improve.	1
It's worth driving up from Tucson! Definitely coming back.	1
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! Highly recommended.	1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.	1
Owner's are really great people.!	1

We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast.	1
Their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite.	1

The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!	1
This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1

Great meal and great hospitality in a clean and friendly setting.	1
This is the restaurant where I first had pho and it was amazing!! Definitely coming back.	1

Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.	1
Food was so gooodd.	1
Service is quick and friendly.	1
Love this spot hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.	1
High-quality chicken on the chicken Caesar salad.	1
Best breakfast buffet!!!	1
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
I liked the patio and the service was outstanding. Loved it overall.	1
If you love authentic Mexican meal and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.	1
It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.	1
The pizza selections are good.	1
I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.	1
The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.	1
This is some seriously excellent pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.	1
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!	1
How awesome is that.	1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
This place is two thumbs up....way up.	1
Reasonably priced also! Highly recommended.	1

Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.	1
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great staff a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.	1
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. Highly recommended.	1
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
